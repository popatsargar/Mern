    <h2>Studying with Reels On</h2>
    <p>Sometimes I multitask while studying — not ideal, but fun! Here’s how it usually goes:</p>

    <div>
      <h3>Focus Challenges</h3>
      <p>Scrolling reels while reading notes makes it hard to stay focused, but music helps keep me calm.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Study Routine</h3>
      <p>I study in short 30-minute sessions followed by quick breaks — it helps me stay fresh and motivated.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
      <p>Balance is key! Too much distraction means less progress, so I’m learning to manage screen time better.</p>
